Our Universal Sister
====================

<b>St Josephine Bakhita, Our Universal Sister</b>

Objectives

<b>Bakhita</b> 
born free in the little Sudanese village of Olgossa in 1869, then captured and sold as a slave when she was about seven years old.

<b>Bakhita</b>  
sold and resold until finally, she leaves her beloved Africa for Italy and a new life.

------

<b>Bakhita</b>  
awakening to the knowledge and love of God, her “Master” above all masters and her response in faith, love and gratitude.<b>Bakhita</b>  
left this world on 8 February 1947, she was declared “Blessed” on 17 May 1992, and proclaimed a “Saint” on 1 October 2000 in Rome.

A child of the Daju tribe of south-western Sudan, Bakhita came from a well-to-do family. Her father was the brother of the village chief. He owned much land, with “plantations and cattle”, and had hired servants working for him.

------

Home was a simple hut, mud-walled and millet stalk-thatched, but happy and loving, with parents, three brothers and four sisters, one of whom was Bakhita’s own twin.

All was lost to her when the slave trades kidnapped her when she was but seven years old. Stripped of the most fundamental human right – personal freedom and dignity – Bakhita endured physical, emotional and spiritual deprivation. There were long forced marches in slave caravans from Olgossa, her village, to El Obied and the slave markets there, then on to Khartoum, changing hands four times over a period of ten years.

The little one, mockingly re-named Bakhita, “The Lucky One”, suffered loneliness and torture … the lot of the slave.

Yet, even reduced to conditions inhuman, Bakhita always knew a certain sense of hope … in what or whom she could not say … then. But somewhere, she knew not how then, she found the strength to live each fearful, miserable, terror-filled day with courage.

Not even slavery, however, could destroy her natural sensitivity and gentleness, that quality of heart that knows compassion. In the midst of her own pain and suffering, and impotent as she was, she could still care about others, commiserate with them, be with them.

This trait she carried with her even when her path led her out of Africa to Italy, where by Divine Providence, she was baptised into the Catholic faith and later took her vows as a Canossian Daughter of Charity.

Whether it was simply offering a drink to a sister in community or a bowl of hot soup to the poor, watching over kindergarten children or tending the wounded during the war, every action was done with love, serenity and gentleness.

Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness …

The one who considered herself “a slave, and an object owned by her masters”, never took advantage of her masters’ property, even under the worst of circumstances and the greatest need. Slave duties were executed with responsibility and an innate sense of justice.

Even before she came to know “the good of God”, she also sensed that there was a higher Power who was in control of every matter under heaven. Because she lived continually in the search of events unfolding around for so as to find the key to encountering this Power, her heart was open and ready when God revealed Himself to her.
