<b>Bakhita</b> 
born free in the little Sudanese village of Olgossa in 1869, then captured and sold as a slave when she was about seven years old.

<b>Bakhita</b>  
sold and resold until finally, she leaves her beloved Africa for Italy and a new life.


<b>Bakhita</b>  
awakening to the knowledge and love of God, her “Master” above all masters and her response in faith, love and gratitude.<b>Bakhita</b>  
left this world on 8 February 1947, she was declared “Blessed” on 17 May 1992, and proclaimed a “Saint” on 1 October 2000 in Rome.

A child of the Daju tribe of south-western Sudan, Bakhita came from a well-to-do family. Her father was the brother of the village chief. He owned much land, with “plantations and cattle”, and had hired servants working for him.


Home was a simple hut, mud-walled and millet stalk-thatched, but happy and loving, with parents, three brothers and four sisters, one of whom was Bakhita’s own twin.

All was lost to her when the slave trades kidnapped her when she was but seven years old. Stripped of the most fundamental human right – personal freedom and dignity – Bakhita endured physical, emotional and spiritual deprivation. There were long forced marches in slave caravans from Olgossa, her village, to El Obied and the slave markets there, then on to Khartoum, changing hands four times over a period of ten years.

The little one, mockingly re-named Bakhita, “The Lucky One”, suffered loneliness and torture … the lot of the slave.

Yet, even reduced to conditions inhuman, Bakhita always knew a certain sense of hope … in what or whom she could not say … then. But somewhere, she knew not how then, she found the strength to live each fearful, miserable, terror-filled day with courage.
