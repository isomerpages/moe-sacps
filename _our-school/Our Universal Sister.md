Stripped of the most fundamental human right – personal freedom and dignity – Bakhita endured physical, emotional and spiritual deprivation. There were long forced marches in slave caravans from Olgossa, her village, to El Obied and the slave markets there, then on to Khartoum, changing hands four times over a period of ten years.</td>

Slave duties were executed with responsibility and an innate sense of justice.<br>Even before she came to know “the good of God”, she also sensed that there was a higher Power who was in control of every matter under heaven. Because she lived continually in the search of events unfolding around for so as to find the key to encountering this Power, her heart was open and ready when God revealed Himself to her.</td>
