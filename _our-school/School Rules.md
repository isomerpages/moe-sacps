School Rules
============

Our school rules describe how a pupil of St Anthonyâ€™s Canossian Primary behaves. Our school believes in positive discipline. Pupils are to adhere to school rules at all times while they are in school. To be truly Canossian, our pupils must learn to respect for self, school and nation.
