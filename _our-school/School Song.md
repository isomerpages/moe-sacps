<h2>School Song</h2>
<p>United in common endeavour
<br>At work and play, life’s lessons we learn
<br>Our youthful hearts are filled with ardour
<br>For truth and wisdom we yearn</p>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Courageously with heads held high
<br>We march ever on through life
<br>Schooled in your spirit Canossa
<br>For virtue, true nobility we strive
<br>Schooled in your spirit Canossa
<br>For true virtue we strive</p>
<p>Our alma mater, our guardian, our guide
<br>Prepare our spirits for duty’s call
<br>Our country to serve with virtuous might
<br>We stand for truth and for right</p>
