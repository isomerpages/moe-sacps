School Song
===========


United in common endeavour  
At work and play, life’s lessons we learn  
Our youthful hearts are filled with ardour  
For truth and wisdom we yearn

<b>Chorus:</b>   
Courageously with heads held high  
We march ever on through life  
Schooled in your spirit Canossa  
For virtue, true nobility we strive  
Schooled in your spirit Canossa  
For true virtue we strive

Our alma mater, our guardian, our guide  
Prepare our spirits for duty’s call  
Our country to serve with virtuous might  
We stand for truth and for right
