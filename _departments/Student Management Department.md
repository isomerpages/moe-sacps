Student Management Department
=============================


<b>Student Management Department</b>

The Student Management Department aims to instil a sense of belonging, build positive peer relationships and discipline climate so that our students learn in a caring and enabling environment.

<u><b>Positive Peer Relationships</b></u>

Positive peer relationships facilitate the provision of care, a sense of belonging amongst students, as well as the building of resilience. Student peer relationships are also powerful channels of positive influence and are excellent opportunities for student voice and empowerment in the school.

There are 3 broad domains (<b>Peer Bonding, Peer Helping and Peer Influencing</b>) we look into and is enacted in two levels, where every student is a peer supporter.
