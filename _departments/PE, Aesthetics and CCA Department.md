PE, Aesthetics and CCA Department
=================================

<b>Physical Education</b>

The Physical Education Programme provides a range of movement experience to develop our students’ overall development. The lower level focuses on mastery of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills with application of movement concepts to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in our students’ performances. The upper level extends on the mastery of discrete skills to focus on more complex combinations and sequences of movements, and skills application in more recognisable forms of activity and games.

Through our programmes and activities, we strive to promote a lifelong healthy lifestyle for themselves and their families.  At the end of their primary school education in St Anthony’s Canossian Primary School, we aim to develop our girls into fine, young women who demonstrate the spirit of excellence in sports through the school’s Sports Motto – Perceive, Believe and Achieve.
