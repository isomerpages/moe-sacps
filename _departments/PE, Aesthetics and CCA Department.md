<p>The Physical Education Programme provides a range of movement experience
to develop our students’ overall development. The lower level focuses on
mastery of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and
manipulative skills with application of movement concepts to develop efficiency,
effectiveness and versatility in our students’ performances. The upper
level extends on the mastery of discrete skills to focus on more complex
combinations and sequences of movements, and skills application in more
recognisable forms of activity and games.</p>

<p>Through our programmes and activities, we strive to promote a lifelong
healthy lifestyle for themselves and their families. Physical education
classes increasingly incorporate educational technology tools such as Plickers
and Padlet to bolster collaborative, interactive, and informational skill
development. In order to acknowledge individual learning and progress,
physical education in SACPS is shifting away from traditional grading systems
and embracing a focus on lifelong learning and the development of personal
portfolios.</p>
<p>Programmes and Activities:</p>
<p>The school has a range of sports programmes and activities to enhance
the development of the physical aspect of the students at different levels.</p>

<p>Through the Music Programme, students will explore different musical genres
and styles, connecting them with their cultural heritage while fostering
an appreciation for the diverse genres of music from around the world.
The Music Programme is designed to enhance the holistic development of
students by instilling values and promoting social-emotional well-being.
It also facilitates the development of psychomotor skills and lays the
groundwork for future educational pursuits in music.</p>

<p>Students are exposed to a range of artworks by Singapore, international
masters/contemporary artists as well as from students from our schools.
To experience art making and art discussion meaningfully, these artworks
are organised under three focus areas and four themes:

<p><strong>The Art Gallery</strong>
</p>
<p>SACPS Art Gallery was set up in 2017. It is a learning space for students
where they learn gallery etiquette and the different roles related to art.
It also creates the opportunity for students to talk about and have a discussion
about the artworks in a safe environment. As part of the Art curriculum,
each cohort will exhibit their artworks at least once a year. The upper
primary students will have an opportunity to curate their own exhibition.</p>

<p>While participation in a CCA is not compulsory for primary level, we strongly
encourage all students to pursue their interests and join a CCA from Primary
3 onwards.</p>
<p>CCA is an important part of the school’s curriculum which provides opportunities
for students to practice self leadership and discover their areas of passion,
interest and growth. CCA provides opportunities for students to develop
their character, learn values, social emotional competencies and other
relevant skills to become future-ready learners. During CCA, students from
diverse backgrounds are also brought together to interact, learn, develop
friendships and a sense of belonging to the school and community.</p>

<p>In Primary 1 and 2, students are given opportunities to try out various
CCAs through the Modular Programme. The school hopes that the experience
would help our girls to learn more about the various CCAs offered by the
school. The programme will also give students opportunities to discover
their areas of interest and then choose a CCA which they would like to
commit to in Primary 3.</p>
