PE, Aesthetics and CCA Department
=================================

**Physical Education (PE)**

The PE Programme provides a range of movement experience to develop our students’ overall development. The lower level focuses on mastery of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills with application of movement concepts to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in our students’ performances. The upper level extends on the mastery of discrete skills to focus on more complex combinations and sequences of movements, and skills application in more recognisable forms of activity and games.&nbsp; Other than the better know PE modules of Sports and Games and Gymnastics, the PE programme also includes lessons on Outdoor Education, Physical Health and Fitness and Dance.&nbsp;

Through our programmes and activities, we strive to promote a lifelong healthy lifestyle for themselves and their families.&nbsp; At the end of their primary school education in St Anthony’s Canossian Primary School, we aim to develop our girls into fine, young women who demonstrate the spirit of excellence in sports through the school’s Sports Motto – Perceive, Believe and Achieve.

Programmes and Activities:

The school has a range of sports programmes and activities to enhance the development of the physical aspect of the students at different levels.

**Performing Arts and Music**

The SACPS Performing Arts and Music Curriculum Programme is a school-wide programme with a strong vision to build a creative and vibrant Arts environment which cultivates confident individuals with an appreciation for the Arts. It also brings to life the teaching of Social Studies through engaging the disciplines of music, movement and drama. It is through this engagement where students discover self and their immediate environment, understand Singapore’s past and appreciate its present and finally extending further to understand the intricate connections Singapore has with the region as well as legacies of civilisations in the world that can be still be seen today.

Programmes Implementation:

There are 4 key components within the programme; Social Studies, Movement, Drama and Music.

At the heart of the Social Studies curriculum is the preparation of our students to be effective citizens by helping them to better understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world they live in, and appreciate the complexities of the human experience. To help actively engage students in the construction of knowledge, the inquiry approach is used to spark students’ curiosity, gather data to find out more, exercise reasoning from the data gathered and finally reflect and think critically of the issue.

Movement, is a key component in our Performing Arts curriculum. We believe that it is through movement that children learn to express their thoughts and feelings. Movement is consciously integrated into drama and music activities.&nbsp; Incorporating movement makes students more excited about learning Social Studies in Performing Arts class. Students also make use of movement to dramatize a story or in conjunction with a music performance.

At SACPS, we believe that all children are creative and need a channel to explore and to express themselves constructively. Drama gives students the opportunity to express emotions with movement and words, thus helping them to develop their cognitive and lingu&nbsp; on istic ability. Drama also opens a student’s horizons to her own abilities and helps to encourage teamwork and build self-confidence. Through the use of drama in the Performing Arts curriculum, students gain a better understanding of the lives of others.

  

The Music syllabus focuses on cultivating and developing our students’ skills and knowledge through providing them direct experiences in the components of Listening, Creating and Performing. While these components are interconnected, the learning outcomes at each level delineate the progressive development in each component that would contribute to a holistic music experience. Musical skills are taught and at the same time used as a tool in the execution preparation of a task.&nbsp;

The syllabus is divided into 3 key stages

*   Stage 1 – P1 and P2
    
*   Stage 2 – P3 and P4
    
*   Stage 3 – P5 and P6
    

The Music syllabus uses three Core Understandings as frames to enable students to find relevance and purpose in their music learning

The three Core Understandings in the syllabus are:&nbsp;

A. Music expresses our experiences and values&nbsp;

B. Music connects individuals and communities&nbsp;

C. Music is shaped by historical, social and cultural contexts&nbsp;

Performing Arts Learning Journeys&nbsp;

Enrichment programmes and learning journeys are integrated into the Performing Arts curriculum-based programme to further enhance the students’ learning experiences.

P2 – Little India Experience

P3 – Sustainable Singapore Gallery

P4 – National Museum

P6 – Asian Civilisation Museum

SACPS Theatre and Art Museum Experience

SACPS Theatre and Art Museum/Gallery Experience focuses on inculcating theatre and art museum/gallery etiquette to the masses. P1 students will go on a theatre experience while P4 students will visit an art museum or gallery. 

Visual Art

The aim of visual art education is to enable every student to enjoy art, communicate visually, and make meaning through connecting with society and culture.

The visual art syllabus is divided into 3 key stages:

*   Stage 1 – P1 and P2
    
*   Stage 2 – P3 and P4
    
*   Stage 3 – P5 and P6
    

3 Big Ideas of Visual Art Education are covered at each key stage to enable students to make meaning and connect art with society and culture. The 3 Big Ideas are:

*   Art helps us see things in new ways
    
*   Art tells stories about our world
    
*   Art influences how we live
    

To help facilitate students’ learning, 3 Focus Areas are drawn up and cover at each level so that different themes, art genres and medium are fully explored. The 3 Focus Areas are:

*   Self and Immediate Environment
    
*   Singapore Past, Present and Future
    
*   The World and Region We Live In
    

At the end of Primary 6, students will be introduced to a selection of local and international artworks within the syllabus.

At each stage of learning, there are 7 Learning Outcomes (LOs) for the students in the following 3 domains of See, Express and Appreciate.

The following Core Programmes are covered within the Visual Art curriculum:

*   Drawing Module – Implemented at each level for students to explore and experiment different drawing techniques.
    
*   Museum-based Learning – implemented at P4 where students go on a learning journey to an art gallery or museum. Formalized exhibition learning experiences are given to students in the other levels within the art classroom where mini exhibitions and gallery walks are conducted. Students also get to learn and play the roles of an artist, an audience, a docent, a curator and a reporter.
    

The Art Gallery

SACPS Art Gallery was set up in 2017 to exhibit works done by students in class as well as those by Art Club members. It is a learning space for students where they learn gallery etiquette and the different roles related to art. It also creates the opportunity for students to talk about and have a discussion about the artworks in a safe environment.

**CCA Policy**

While it is important for our children to have a strong foundation in the academics, it is equally vital for them to be engaged in a CCA that will help them build character and camaraderie.

In Primary 1 and 2, students are given opportunities to try out various CCAs through the Modular Programme. The school hopes that the experience would help our girls to discover their areas of interest and choose a CCA which they would like to commit to. All Primary 4 to Primary 6 are strongly encouraged to commit to a CCA in school.

The school recommends that a student remains in the same CCA for the subsequent years as this would build her sense of loyalty. On top of that, your child would be able to enhance and improve her skills in that CCA.
