<h1>Education Technology Department</h1>
<p>ICT in classrooms is essential as it better prepares our current generation
of students for a workplace where ICTs are becoming more ubiquitous. Therefore,
in SACPS, we integrate ICT in the curriculum, focusing on learning about,
with and through technology. Through this, we hope to increase our studentsâ€™
motivation and engagement level and facilitate their acquisition of basic
ICT skills, hence enhancing the quality of their learning. Appropriate
ICT activities have been planned within each subject to promote the shift
to a learner-centered environment that will empower our students for lifelong
learning.</p>
<p>Although we are living in a rapidly changing technology world, the department
makes an extra effort to ensure that the learning objectives drive the
technology choice. The school has been wireless-enabled to create avenues
for online learning anywhere within the school premises. This is further
enhanced with the implementation of mobile labs. We are blessed with the
following facilities for a more vibrant ICT environment to conduct engaging
ICT-based lessons:-</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>3 Full Networked Labs with Printers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 Innovation Room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>iPad Mobile Carts at each level of the classrooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 mobile carts (20 laptops each)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 mini Recording Studio</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With the e-Learning platform, Student Learning Space, SLS, our teachers
and students have a wealth of learning materials in almost every subject
and in a variety of media. It can be accessed anywhere and anytime with
a valid account. The iPad has been an indispensable teaching tool use by
teachers. Teachers use iPads applications to create and customize interesting
and engaging lesson resources. These lesson resources are organized into
lesson packages which teachers use with effective pedagogies to engage
students in self-directed or collaborative learning. Teaching and learning
of the new topics become more exciting and meaningful for both teachers
and students.</p>
