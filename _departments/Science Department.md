==================

The Science departmental programmes have been designed to develop students with a strong fundamental in scientific knowledge, practices and values. Opportunities are provided where students can physically explore, investigate and discover knowledge. With the development of positive attitudes such as curiosity, confidence, perseverance and a concern for living things, students will be able to effectively integrate and link new concepts to their prior experiences.

Students are nurtured to be scientifically literate, so that they are able to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in their daily lives. With strong Science fundamentals, students are able to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.

**<u>Programmes:</u>**<br>
Students’ interests are aroused through fun and discovery and their acquisition of knowledge maximised through inquiry-based learning to promote the joy of learning in Science. Our thematic science programmes are carefully planned to equip our students with the necessary foundation in understanding the basics of physical and life sciences without compromising the element of fun!

**Applied Learning Programme**<br>
The objective of the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – ‘Inno-Eco-Creator’ (IEC) programme is to empower students with the knowledge, skills and tools, to be innovative in seeking solutions to solve real-world issues on sustainability through inquiry-based learning.

**Mushroom Farming Workshop**<br>
P3 students experienced mushroom farming and learn how mushrooms play a very important role in nature as decomposers. The hands-on experiential learning not only enriched the students’ learning but also promote the joy of learning Science.

**Upcycling Workshop**<br>
The enrichment programme equips the P4 students with relevant ecological literacy coupled with an understanding of Singapore’s Agri-Food ecosystem. Through this interactive and virtual workshop, the school hopes to groom students to be Eco stewards of the future.

**Food Sustainability Workshop**<br>
The objective of the workshop is to create greater awareness amongst P5 students on sustainability through natural farming techniques. Through this hands-on workshop, students would have a deeper understanding of servant leadership through caring and service for others.

**Fun Science on Electricity**<br>
This programme serves to help students construct fundamental concepts of electricity. Through experimentation and hands-on activities, P5 students will get to explore concepts such as parallel and series circuits, electrical connections, identifying electrical conductors and insulators. Students will be engaged in fun circuit construction using the Electricity Kit.

**Aquatic Plants &amp; Animals Workshop at Science Centre**<br> 
P6 students will be taught field techniques to catch and observe a variety of aquatic plants and animals which make up the pond community. In the process, they will learn about relationships between organisms in the pond ecosystem which is teeming with life forms, from microscopic algae to pond skaters and even the occasional water monitor!

**Physics Learning Trail**<br>
This learning trail curated for P6 students is meant to engage them in meaningful joyful learning. It incorporated Science concepts on Energy Conversion, Forces and Sound, as well as, basic scientific report writing and graphing skills.

**Learning Journeys**<br>
Students will also embark on learning journeys that will expand their learning beyond the confines of the classroom, providing opportunities to connect the concepts they have learnt with real-life experiences they encounter in their surroundings. Some of the learning journeys planned include the following:

**Community Aquaponics Project (CAP)**

**Closed Loop Integrated Project (CLIP) at Tampines Park**

**Gardens by the Bay (Flower Dome)**
