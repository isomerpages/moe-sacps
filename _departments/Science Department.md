Science Department
==================

The Science departmental programmes have been designed to provide opportunities where students can physically explore, investigate and discover knowledge, be it within their own natural environment or in the laboratory. With the development of positive attitudes such as curiosity, perseverance and a concern for living things, our students will be able to effectively integrate and link new concepts to their existing body of knowledge and schema of concepts. We seek enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate, so that they are able to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in their daily lives; and provide strong Science fundamentals for students to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.

Basic process skills are introduced to students from Primary 3 onwards to enable them to carry out creative problem solving and scientific investigations. These basic process skills include – Classifying, Observing, Comparing, Measuring and Using apparatus, Communicating, Analysing, Generating and Evaluating.

Integrated processes are complex operations, which call upon the use of several basic process skills. The integrated processes expected of primary school students are as follows – Creative Problem Solving, Decision Making and Investigation.

<b>Programmes:</b>

Students’ interests are aroused through fun and discovery and their acquisition of knowledge maximised through inquiry-based learning to promote the joy of learning in Science. Our thematic science programmes are carefully planned to equip our students with the necessary foundation in understanding the basics of physical and life sciences without compromising the element of fun!

*   <b>Applied Learning Programme</b>  
    The objective of the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – <b>‘Inno-Eco-Creator’</b> (<b>IEC</b>) programme is to empower students with the knowledge, skills and tools, to be innovative in seeking solutions to solve real-world issues on sustainability through inquiry-based learning. Opportunities will be provided for our students to develop 21st century competencies such as “Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills” and “Critical and Inventive Thinking”. At the end of the programme, it is hoped that students can be advocators with global awareness for environmental protection so as to be concerned and compassionate citizens of tomorrow. This is in cognisant that the school already has a very strong culture in promoting environmental education through the ‘Good Girls Go Green’ programme led by the Environment Committee.
    
    The school’s <b>IEC</b> programme is a two-tiered programme with Tier 1 embedded in the P3-5 Science Curriculum. Tier 1 of the <b>IEC</b> programme is a 3-year journey with a spiral development from P3 to P5. In Tier 2 of the <b>IEC</b> programme, additional opportunities are provided for students with greater aptitude and interest. There will be a talent development platform, in collaboration with the Infocomm CCA, for students who exhibit exceptional talent in programming and are interested to go beyond the Tier 1 level programmes.
    
    The table below highlights how the programme will be spiralled up and the overall structure of the <b>IEC</b> programme.
