InfoComm Technology Department
==============================


<b>InfoComm Technology Department</b>

ICT in classrooms is essential as it better prepares our current generation of students for a workplace where ICTs are becoming more ubiquitous. Therefore, in SACPS, we integrate ICT in the curriculum, focusing on learning about, with and through technology. Through this, we hope to increase our students’ motivation and engagement level and facilitate their acquisition of basic ICT skills, hence enhancing the quality of their learning. Appropriate ICT activities have been planned within each subject to promote the shift to a learner-centered environment that will empower our students for lifelong learning.

Although we are living in a rapidly changing technology world, the department makes an extra effort to ensure that the learning objectives drive the technology choice. The school has been wireless-enabled to create avenues for online learning anywhere within the school premises. This is further enhanced with the implementation of mobile labs. We are blessed with the following facilities for a more vibrant ICT environment to conduct engaging ICT-based lessons:-

1.  3 Full Networked Labs with Printers
2.  1 Innovation Room
3.  iPad Mobile Carts at each level of the classrooms
4.  4 mobile carts (20 laptops each)
5.  1 mini Recording Studio

With the e-Learning platform, Student Learning Space, SLS, our teachers and students have a wealth of learning materials in almost every subject and in a variety of media. It can be accessed anywhere and anytime with a valid account. The iPad has been an indispensable teaching tool use by teachers. Teachers use iPads applications to create and customize interesting and engaging lesson resources. These lesson resources are organized into lesson packages which teachers use with effective pedagogies to engage students in self-directed or collaborative learning. Teaching and learning of the new topics become more exciting and meaningful for both teachers and students.
