<b>Pastoral Care</b>

The Pastoral Care programme consists of weekly Pastoral Care (Catholic & Non-Catholic) lessons, liturgical events, termly values talks, and post-PSLE Programmes.

The school has designed a programme to teach values and life skills to our students. Imbued in the lessons are stories of the lives of our Canossian Saints and other individuals who have made contributions to mankind. We hope to inspire our children with the stories so that they can grow in their personhood.

The themes for the PC-Catechism is as follows:

Theme:  
P1-P3 : Make Jesus Known and Loved  
P4-P6:  Ours Is A Life Built On Love

P1: Knowing Jesus  
P2: Loving Jesus  
P3: His Love

P4: Jesus Crucified  
P5: Jesus Risen  
P6: Living in His Love

<b>Canossian Spirituality</b>

The school believes that each child is precious, unique and deserves to be respected. In line with this belief, the school takes care of the spiritual growth of each child as a person through various celebrations and commemorations of events:

*   Opening of School Year Mass
*   Stations of the Cross
*   Lenten Retreat for Catholic Students
*   Rite of Reconciliation for Catholic Students
*   Level Mass
*   Easter Para-Liturgy
*   May Devotion cum Mother’s Day Celebration
*   St Anthony’s Feast Day Mass
*   International Peace Day
*   Children’s Day Mass
*   Thanksgiving Liturgy
*   P6 Thanksgiving

The Chaplaincy Team takes care of the faith formation of the Catholic students in the school. Sr Gerry, Sr Jessica, Sr Doreen and Sr Joanna, work with the Chaplaincy Team in the school to ensure that the strong are encouraged, the weak are supported and the indifferent are challenged, so that all may have ‘life to the full’ (John 10:10)

<b>Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)</b>

Introduced in 2012, the FTGP is time set aside each week for teachers to engage in quality interactions with their students so as to develop and strengthen their social and emotional competencies.

During the weekly 30-minute FTGP lessons, teachers will conduct interactive sessions with their students so as to develop strong class bonds, create quality teacher-student relationships and to explicitly teach social and emotional competencies.

<b>National Education (NE)</b>

NE is infused into the core and non-core curriculum at St Anthony’s Canossian Primary School. We aim to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and instil in our students a sense of identity, pride and confidence in our nation’s future. To do this, we provide varied NE experiences:

*   Commemoration of the 4 core NE events
    *   Total Defence Day
    *   International Friendship Day
    *   Racial Harmony Day
    *   National Day
*   Learning Journeys
*   P5 NE Show

<b>Values in Action (VIA)</b>

VIA are learning experiences which support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community. As part of VIA, the students reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.

By serving others as a Canossian Service Leader, we hope our students will grow as persons embracing the school’s core values of Charity, Humility and Forgiveness.

<b>Character & Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons</b>

In 2014, MOE introduced a new CCE syllabus to replace the previous Civic & Moral Education lessons. These lessons are carried out in the various Mother Tongue languages and in English for students who are exempted from Mother Tongue.

The new curriculum will help students to better learn values through three overarching ideas – Identity, Relationships and Choices. Included in the curriculum are National Education (NE) elements and these are explicitly taught during lessons leading up to the 4 NE commemorative events.

A new feature in in the CCE syllabus is ‘Family Time’ – the suggested activities encourage parents to reinforce their child’s learning and promote family bonding.

<b>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</b>

1.  Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.
2.  The goals of Sexuality Education are:
    *   To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate <i>knowledge</i> on human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;
    *   To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships through the acquisition of <i>social and emotional skills</i> of self-awareness, management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy for others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and decision-making skills; and
    *   To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for others as sexual beings, premised on the family as the basic unit of society, through the inculcation of <i>positive mainstream values and attitudes</i> about sexuality.
3.  The key messages of Sexuality Education are:
    *   Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;
    *   Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong families);
    *   Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and
    *   Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.
