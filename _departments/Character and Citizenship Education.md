<p>The Character and Citizenship Education Department aims to provide our
students with multiple opportunities to develop and acquire values, knowledge
and skills through varied classroom lessons and school experiences. Various
platforms are used to create authentic learning experiences so that students
will be able to put their learning into action for the internalisation
of skills and values.</p>
<p><strong>CCE Platforms</strong>
</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pastoral Care</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canossian Spirituality</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; National Education&nbsp; (NE)</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Values in Action (VIA)</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Character &amp; Citizenship Education
(CCE) lessons</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cyber Wellness</p>
<p><strong>Pastoral Care</strong>
</p>
<p>The Pastoral Care programme consists of weekly Pastoral Care (Catholic
&amp; Non-Catholic) lessons, liturgical events, termly values talks, and
post-PSLE Programmes.</p>
<p>The school has designed a programme to teach values and life skills to
our students. Imbued in the lessons are stories of the lives of our Canossian
Saints and other individuals who have made contributions to mankind. We
hope to inspire our children with the stories so that they can grow in
their personhood.</p>
<p><strong>Canossian Spirituality</strong>
</p>
<p>The school believes that each child is precious, unique and deserves to
be respected. In line with this belief, the school takes care of the spiritual
growth of each child as a person through various celebrations and commemorations
of events:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opening of School Year Mass</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stations of the Cross</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lenten Retreat for Catholic Students</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rite of Reconciliation for Catholic Students</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Level Mass</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Easter Para-Liturgy</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May Devotion cum Mother’s Day Celebration</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; St Anthony’s Feast Day Mass</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International Peace Day</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children’s Day Mass</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanksgiving Liturgy</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P6 Thanksgiving</p>
<p>The Chaplaincy Team takes care of the faith formation of the Catholic
students in the school. Sr Gerry, Sr Jessica, Sr Doreen and Sr Joanna,
work with the Chaplaincy Team in the school to ensure that the strong are
encouraged, the weak are supported and the indifferent are challenged,
so that all may have ‘life to the full’ (John 10:10)</p>
<p><strong>Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)</strong>
</p>
<p>The FTGP is time set aside each week for teachers to engage in quality
interactions with their students so as to develop and strengthen their
social and emotional competencies.</p>
<p>During the weekly FTGP lessons, teachers will conduct interactive sessions
with their students so as to develop strong class bonds, create quality
teacher-student relationships and to explicitly teach social and emotional
competencies.</p>
<p><strong>National Education (NE)</strong>
<br>NE is infused into the core and non-core curriculum at St Anthony’s Canossian
Primary School. We aim to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct
for survival as a nation and instil in our students a sense of identity,
pride and confidence in our nation’s future. To do this, we provide varied
NE experiences:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commemoration of the 4 core NE events
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total Defence Day
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International Friendship Day
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Racial Harmony Day
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; National Day
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning Journeys
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P5 NE Show</p>

<p><strong>Values in Action @ SACPS</strong>
<br>VIA are learning experiences which support students’ development as socially
responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community. As part
of VIA, the students reflect on their experience, the values they have
put into practice and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.</p>
<p>By serving others as a Canossian Service Leader, we hope our students
will grow as persons embracing the school’s core values of Charity, Humility,
Faith and Forgiveness.</p>

<p><strong>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools aims to enable students
to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience
as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships with others,
including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed
and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the
importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging
healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended
family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for
the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities
in Singapore on sexuality issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a) Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>(b) Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on
sexuality matters.</p>
<p>(c) Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and
others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality
that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp; The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a) Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b) Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are
the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>(c) Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society;
and</p>
<p>(d) Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>

more information on MOE Sexuality Education.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp; Sexuality Education is delivered in a holistic manner through
the school curriculum. The content for Sexuality Education is grouped into
five main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal Relationships, Sexual
Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and Law. You may click
<a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>for more information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the
school curriculum.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp; The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality include:</p>
<p>(a) Science</p>
<p>(b) Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Sexuality Education Lessons</u></strong>:</p>
<p>6. &nbsp; The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty. With better
nutrition and improved health care, children are reaching puberty at a
younger age and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological
changes in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming
biologically ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having
the corresponding cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours.
Furthermore, our young are also exposed to a wide range of influences that
could endanger health and undermine the integrity of the family. Our students
require close guidance so that they can respond with discernment to the
sexual messages in the media and other sources.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught as part of CCE
(FTGP) at Primary 5 and 6.Through these lessons, students will learn healthy
ways to manage the physiological, social and emotional changes in their
growing years. They learn to build healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex. Students
are also guided to make wise, informed and responsible decisions to keep
themselves safe from sexuality-related risks.</p>
<p><strong>At St Anthony’s Canossian Primary School, the following Sexuality Education lessons will be taught in 2026:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
