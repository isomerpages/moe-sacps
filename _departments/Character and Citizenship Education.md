<b>Pastoral Care</b>

The Pastoral Care programme consists of weekly Pastoral Care (Catholic & Non-Catholic) lessons, liturgical events, termly values talks, and post-PSLE Programmes.

The school has designed a programme to teach values and life skills to our students. Imbued in the lessons are stories of the lives of our Canossian Saints and other individuals who have made contributions to mankind. We hope to inspire our children with the stories so that they can grow in their personhood.

The themes for the PC-Catechism is as follows:

Theme:  
P1-P3 : Make Jesus Known and Loved  
P4-P6:  Ours Is A Life Built On Love

P1: Knowing Jesus  
P2: Loving Jesus
