The series of books selected for the Guided Reading Programme are pitched at the pupil’s instructional level. At the beginning of semester 2, the P2 pupils will begin reading chapter books of a more complex nature. The books range from classics to modern children’s literature.

Pupils will hold a title for a period of 2 weeks. During this period, teachers will conduct activities to teach reading and comprehension skills. The series of books used will be rotated amongst the classes within their level and at the end of the programme, the pupils will be given two books to keep.

At the end of Term 1, the EL Department organises a Teddy Bear Picnic to celebrate the end of the first term for the Primary 1 pupils. Parents are invited to this event so that they will have an understanding of what school is like for their daughters.

At the picnic, pupils showcase a poetry recitation for their parents and classmates and this is followed by a publishing party. Here, parents and classmates read stories written by the Primary 1 pupils during the term and provide encouraging compliments to spur them to be better writers.

*   <b>Mum & Me Day (P2)</b>

Mum & Me Day is an event the EL department organises at the end of Term 2 for Primary 2 pupils and their mothers. Before this event, the pupils would prepare a special writing piece about their mothers to express their appreciation for them. They will also prepare a Readers’ Theatre performance for their mothers and classmates.

After a short snack time, pupils and their mothers create a piece of craftwork together. At the end of craft time, the pupils will present this token of love to their mother as Mother’s Day is celebrated in the month of May.
