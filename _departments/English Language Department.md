The EL department has customised a writing programme to suit the developmental needs of our pupils from Primary 3 to Primary 6.

Before writing, teachers take pupils through a brainstorming process to gather ideas for writing. Next, a specific writing skill is taught during a mini-lesson. In a single cycle of writing, pupils are taught a variety of writing skills targeted at their weaknesses. They also have one to one conferencing with their teachers to get individualised feedback on their writing. When they complete a piece, they are taught to edit and prepare their pieces for publishing. This part of the writing process is introduced to give our young writers a larger audience, motivating them to write more and write better.
