<p>The MOE’s Mathematics Framework above sets direction and provides guidance
for the school’s teaching and learning, and assessment of mathematics.
As the central focus of the framework above is mathematical problem solving,
the school ensures that the pupils are given opportunities to solve problems
using mathematics. This is done through the deliberate teaching of process
skills, integrated with the learning of concepts and skills.</p>

<br><strong>Math Learning Experiences @ SACPS</strong>
<br>Learning Mathematics is more than just learning concepts and skills. Equally
important are the cognitive and metacognitive process skills. These processes
are learned through carefully constructed learning experiences.
<br>• Learning Experience Activities in the Topical Worksheets - to discover
mathematical results and be engaged with mathematical experiences using
manipulative which allow them to see the relevance of what they learn in
class with their daily lives.
<br>• Mini Projects - to provide students with hands-on learning experiences
that will give students an understanding of how math works in and around
them and facilitate their creativity and knowledge in real life situations
that involve mathematical concepts.</p>
