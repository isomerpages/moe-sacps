Mathematics Department
======================

<b>Objectives</b>

1.  To foster the joy and love of learning Math
2.  To develop necessary mathematical concepts and skills
3.  To develop cognitive and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving
4.  To develop students to think, communicate and reason logically and critically
5.  To empower students to be leaders in facilitating Mathematics learning among their peers

<b>MOE’s Mathematics Framework</b>

![](/images/MathDept1.png)

The MOE’s Mathematics Framework above sets direction and provides guidance for the school’s teaching and learning, and assessment of mathematics. As the central focus of the framework above is mathematical problem solving, the school ensures that the pupils are given opportunities to solve problems using mathematics. This is done through the deliberate teaching of process skills, integrated with the learning of concepts and skills.

<b>Programmes:</b>

<b>Let’s Have Fun with Math @ SACPS</b> 

*   <b>Math Playground</b>

The Math Playground was designed with the aim of providing students with a wide variety of games that they can choose to play during recess, after school or Learning Through Play programme. They are free to enjoy the games on their own or with their friends. These games provide opportunities for building students’ mathematical concepts and developing positive attitudes towards mathematics.

*   <b>Fluency through Games</b>

Games are used in our classrooms as a strategy to provide students with fun ways to develop their number sense by computing accurately and efficiently, detecting errors and using Math facts repeatedly. Students’ thinking also becomes more apparent through the actions and decisions they make while paying these games.

*   <b>Math Bi-monthly Competitions by levels</b>

Once every two months, the department conducts Math competitions that cater to the different levels. It aims to provide students the opportunity to strive for personal achievement while providing them an encouraging environment to compete, excel and honour students’ courage and abilities. Some examples of these competitions include Sudoku and Math puzzles.

*   <b>Multiplication Challenge</b>

To support pupils’ learning of Multiplication facts, Interclass Multiplication Challenge is organised for P2 to P5 pupils. It aims to strengthen pupils’ speed and accuracy in multiplication. It starts with a preliminary round which is held in class. After which, semi-final and final rounds are held in front of an audience (level pupils and teachers).

*   <b>E2K</b>

E2K Math Programme aims to develop students’ mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. Students will have opportunities to work independently or collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through resources such as puzzles, games and math explorations.

*   <b>National Math Competitions</b>

These competitions aim to provide high achieving students opportunities to discover their talent through solving challenging problems and/or carry out innovative and creative work in math, different from those learnt in class.

<b>Math Learning Experiences @ SACPS</b>

Learning Mathematics is more than just learning concepts and skills. Equally important are the cognitive and metacognitive process skills. These processes are learned through carefully constructed learning experiences.

*   <b>LE Activities</b>

In SACPS, LE Activities are explicitly incorporated in students’ school-based Topical worksheets. These activities are carefully crafted by the level teachers and they provide students opportunities to discover mathematical results on their own or discuss, articulate and explain ideas to develop reasoning and communication skills.  These activities also allow students to be engaged with mathematical experiences using manipulative which allow them to see the relevance of what they learn in class with their daily lives.

*   <b>Mini Projects</b>

Often than not, students do not fully grasp ideas and concepts that they have learnt. With the introduction of Mini Projects for P1 to P5, the department aim to provide students with hands-on learning experiences that will give students an understanding of how math works in and around them. As they are applying what they have learnt, these projects will also facilitate students’ creativity and knowledge while identifying real life situations that involve mathematical concepts.

*   <b>P1 A-Math-zing Race</b>

In teams, P1 pupils strive to solve math problems given at each station. Clues are provided which lead students to the next destination or direct them to perform a task. The race is designed to challenge students’ ability to collaborate with others, think critically and solve Mathematical problems effectively.

*   <b>Learning Journeys</b>

In collaboration with the English Department, P1 and P2 students embark on integrated learning journeys to experience outdoor literacy and numeracy learning.

Through their visit to the Zoo, P1 pupils are able to immerge in nature and be amongst the animals while solving related mathematical problems. In groups, pupils are given the opportunity to observe their surroundings and have conversations with their group members and finally come to a consensus on their solutions to real problems.

P2 students on the other hand, visit the supermarket to have a real life experience with numbers and money. This is made possible with prior planning whereby students discuss within their groups the ingredients to purchase for their sandwich–making activity which is to be conducted after the supermarket trip. Not only do they experience selecting, purchasing and paying for their items, they also learn the value of money as they have to restrict themselves to spend within the given budget
