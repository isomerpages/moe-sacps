The MOE’s Mathematics Framework above sets direction and provides guidance for the school’s teaching and learning, and assessment of mathematics. As the central focus of the framework above is mathematical problem solving, the school ensures that the pupils are given opportunities to solve problems using mathematics. This is done through the deliberate teaching of process skills, integrated with the learning of concepts and skills.
