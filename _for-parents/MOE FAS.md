-----------------------------------------
#### Note: For more information on the MOE FAS, please [click here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance).


### **Who is eligible**

Students who:

*   Are Singapore Citizens.
*   Attend government or government-aided schools.
*   Have a monthly gross household income of $3,000 or less, or a monthly per capita income of $750 or less.

### **Difference between gross household income and per capita income**

To calculate per capita income, divide the monthly gross household income by the number of people living in the same household. This allows students from larger families to benefit from the scheme.

### **How it works**

Under MOE FAS, your child will receive:

*   A full subsidy of standard miscellaneous fees. Singapore Citizens do not need to pay school fees in primary schools.
*   Free textbooks and school attire.
*   One of the following transport subsidies:
    *   Covers 65% of school bus fares per year if your child takes the school bus.
    *   $17 transport credit per month, or up to $204 per year, if your child takes public transport.
*   A $2.60 per meal subsidy for school meals, applicable to 7 meals per school week.

### **How to apply**

You can apply [online](https://go.gov.sg/moe-efas). Alternatively, you can download the [MOE FAS application form](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/-/media/932c5159d07c4a128d30374925806a6a.ashx) or collect a copy at your child’s school. Submit the completed form directly to the school.  
  
**Tip**: If you have children in different government or government-aided schools, you can submit 1 application form to any of their schools. The school that receives the application form will inform you of the outcome.

### **Additional financial help**

If you require further financial assistance beyond the MOE FAS, you can approach your child’s school to find out more about their school-based financial assistance. Your request will be evaluated by the school on a case-by-case basis.

Students from low-income households can apply for a subsidised computer, broadband or both through the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)’s [digital access programme](http://www.digitalaccess.gov.sg/). If you have questions about the programme, you can contact IMDA at [6377 3800](tel:+6563773800) or [info@imda.gov.sg](mailto:info@imda.gov.sg).   
  
Besides financial assistance schemes, MOE has merit-based awards and scholarships that your child may also qualify. [Learn about it](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/~/link.aspx?_id=44021942612840EE9EE800704F6EF013&_z=z).
